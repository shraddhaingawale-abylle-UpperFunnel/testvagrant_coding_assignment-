Create an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user pairs, with each song linked to a user. It should also be able to fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.
all the modules related to the problem statements are written inside code.java
